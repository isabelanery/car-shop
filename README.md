# Car Shop

## About
Project developed at Back-End Development Module of Trybe's Web Development course. It was approved with 100% of the mandatory and optional requirements met.

The goal was to develop a RESTful API following SOLID principles, and its unit tests. 

The application has all basic CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations on generic classes, and extended to manipulate different tables on the database.

This project helped me to better understand the potencial of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and to make a better use of it.
